## üåü Project Overview

HMS is a distributed hospital management system that leverages .NET Remoting for seamless communication between client and server components. Built with a focus on reliability and performance, it offers comprehensive tools for managing healthcare facilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system is built on a robust three-tier architecture:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Middle Layer (Middle_Hosp)
- `RPC.cs`: Core interface defining all remote procedures
  - Common Properties:
    - Basic personal information (ID, name, contact details)
    - Address and gender information
  - Doctor-specific Features:
    - Specialization management
    - Department assignment
    - Status tracking
  - Patient-specific Features:
    - Medical information (blood type, diagnosis)
    - Doctor assignments
    - Room management
  - Core Operations:
    - CRUD operations for doctors and patients
    - Authentication and user management
    - Department and specialization lookups
    - Real-time data retrieval

Serves as the contract layer between client and server, ensuring type safety and operation consistency across the distributed system.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Server Layer (Server_Hosp)
Core business logic implementation:
- `Doctor.cs`: Doctor management operations (CRUD, department/specialization handling, status management)
- `Patient.cs`: Patient management operations (CRUD, room assignments, medical records)
- `LoginService.cs`: Authentication services (user validation, session handling)
- `RegisterService.cs`: User registration with duplicate checking
- `ServerManager.cs`: Server configuration, TCP channel setup, connection management, and error handling
- `Program.cs`: Server initialization and service registration

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Client Layer (Client_Hosp)
Modern Windows Forms interfaces:
- `LoginForm.cs` & `RegisterForm.cs`: User authentication
- `MainForm.cs`: Application container
- `Dashboard.cs`: System overview
- `AddDoctor.cs`: Doctor management
- `AddPatient.cs`: Patient management
- `AddRoom.cs`: Room allocation
- `ConnectionManager.cs`: Network handling
- `Program.cs`: Client initialization

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üë§ User Management
- Secure authentication system
- New user registration
- Session management
- Connection state handling

  - Gender specification
- Status tracking with options:
  - Available
  - In Consultation
  - On Break
  - Off Duty
  - In Surgery
  - Emergency
- Real-time list view updates
- CRUD operations with validation
- Department assignment
- Specialization tracking
- Real-time availability updates

### üèÉ Patient Care
- Comprehensive patient records:
  - Personal information
  - Blood type tracking
  - Medical history
  - Doctor assignments
  - Room allocation
  - Diagnosis management
- Real-time updates
- Patient-doctor matching
- Room management

### üìä Dashboard Features
- Total doctor count display
- Total Patient count display
- Real-time data updates

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- SQL Server 2019 or later
- Visual Studio 2019+ with .NET Framework 4.5+
- Windows OS (for .NET Remoting)

### Database Setup
1. Create a new SQL Server database
2. Execute the following schema setup scripts (in `Database` folder):
   - `01_CreateTables.sql`
   - `02_InitialData.sql`
3. Update connection string in `ServerManager.cs`:
   ```csharp
   private const string YOUR_DB = @"Data Source=YOUR_SERVER\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=YOUR_DATABASE;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;";
   ```
4. Set your connection string as active:
   ```csharp
   public static readonly string ConnectionString = YOUR_DB;
   ```

### Server Configuration
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio
2. Set `Server_Hosp` as the startup project
3. Build and run the server
4. Verify the console shows: "Server is running on port 2222!"

### Client Setup
1. Ensure the server is running
2. Set `Client_Hosp` as the startup project
3. Build and run the client
4. Use the login form to access the system
   - Default credentials:
     - Username: admin
     - Password: admin123

### Troubleshooting
- If connection fails, verify:
  - SQL Server is running
  - Connection string is correct
  - Server application is running
  - Port 2222 is not blocked by firewall

### Development Setup
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HMS.git
   ```
2. Open `Client_Hosp.sln` in Visual Studio
3. Restore NuGet packages
4. Build the entire solution
